Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Time Series Forecasting

This project is a collection of machine learning algorithms that I implemented for a time series forecasting problem. Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) and Long Short - Term Memory Networks are implemented. 

##Objective
To predict six-hourly (four times a day) values of storm surge height at a specified location by making use of neighboring oceanographic/atmospheric data such as wind speed and mean sea-level pressure.

#Dataset
Six hourly time series values of wind speed, mean sea-level pressure, and observed storm surge height at Cuxhaven (coastal city in Germany)
